# School

**A school is organization that has learning of students in its core. A school can have several sections, like Kindergarten, primary school, middle school, high school.**

In the School doctype, you can register your School and its sections.  

To access the school doctype, go to:

> Home > School Settings > School

You can start by entering your main school. If you have only one school with just one section.  Just put its name and abbreviation.  If there are several sections, you can tick the **is group** check box.  This means that it becomes what we call a *parent* school.

The school doctype has a tree view.
