# Department

**A Department is a team of educators that collaborate together around a discipline (the Arts dpt. or the Math dpt.) or around a category of students (the Learning Support dpt., the Middle School dpt.)**

A department can be linked to a particular section of your school but does not have to.  Usually each department has a lead.
