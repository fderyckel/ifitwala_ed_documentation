# Introduction

"Fitwala" is a Bemba word (one of the language spoken in Zambia) meaning "which Growth".  

Ifitwala Education is a an app designed to managed schools, students, educators, and the community that makes them.  The ambition of ifitwala is to be as much an SIS (Student Information System) as a curriculum management System as well as what we traditionally call ERP (with assets management and Human Resource Modules)  


## 1.  What does Ifitwala Education provide?

Here are the working modules you could expect:

* An education Setting module.  Create your schools and its sections, your school calendars, department, your collaborative meetings.  
* A student module.  Demographics about students and their guardians. Logging information about students throughout the year with Log Entries, Student Review Meetings.  
* A health module.  Record the health profile of your students.  Record any visit to your school health practitioner.
* A schedule module.  Create your programs, your courses, your instructor, your enrollments, attendances.
* An asset module.  Set up your rooms and your inventory.
* A curriculum module.  Link your curriculum to your courses.
* An assessment module.  Set up all your assessments (be formative or summative), set up your grade scales, your assessment criteria with their grade descriptors, etc.  Generate reports.
* A parent portal to see your curriculum, book appointment, see children results.
* A Human Resource module.  Set up your employees, their holidays.


## 2. Ifitwala Education vs ERPNext.  

Ifitwala Education is a frappe app like ERPNext. It is exclusively developed to be used as a School Management System with a strong focus on analytics.  Although Ifitwala Education has used many doctypes from the ERPNext Education Domain, it has totally rebuild them from the ground up, adding extra validation rules for even more data integrity and adding also more default behaviors to ease the use of the app.  ERPNext is a whole ERP suite that can cater for a wide variety of business.  

<p> So why a different app? </p>

Too many doctype within the Education Domain have not been built with educators and students in mind.  You can think of Company, Department, items, etc.  These are more suited for businesses (not that education cannot be a business in its own right)

With that in mind, we thought we would rebuild a similar app developed exclusively for schools.  We have also changed the logic behind some doctype and we think we have build more robust validation rules.
