# Introduction

## 1. Ifitwala Education vs ERPNext.  

Ifitwala Education is a frappe app like ERPNext. It is exclusively developed to be used as a School Management System with a strong focus on analytics.  ERPNext is a whole ERP suite that can cater for a wide variety of business.  ERPNext has also an education module and many doctypes in Ifitwala Education have been taken straight from ERPNext.

<p> So why a different app? </p>

The way the Desktop has been set in ERPNext is overwhelming for any educators due to high numbers of modules irrelevant in the teaching practice.  

With that in mind, we thought we would rebuild a similar app developed exclusively for schools.  We have also changed some logic behind some doctype and we have build more robust validation rules to ensure the validity of data.

## 2.  What does Ifitwala Education provide?

Here are the working modules you could expect:
